# Q_learning (value-based)
# -- Can also use QDN
# Policy Gradient (policy-based)
# -- NN with loss function related to env, actions
# -- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) Clip/Penalty for bigger changes in new policy
# -- Actor-Critic (add the evaluation of Gt in the loss function of basic policy gradient)


# RL usually need policy + networks together to give action probability under envs
